            <h2>A little about myself:</h2>
              <p>My name is Michael Nancett. I am an aspiring
                web developer. ðŸ˜Ž I have lived in Modesto, Ca in California's central
                valley my whole life. I love getting out to the big cities that are close
                to me as well as in nature in the various beaches, and
                forests around me. I currently work in the healthcare industry as a pharmacy tech. Web
                development has always interested me, honestly much of programming, does. I started
                with swift and building an app, and wanted more.  So I started tinkering with html
                and css found I really enjoyed that. I decided I wanted to take that interest and
                make a career doing something I enjoy.</p>

            <h2><strong>Hey Now</strong></h2>
              <p>Web development has been something that has been an interest for me for almost 2
               decades now.  I have been on the internet since dail up. I remember very early basic
             websites and their evolution has always fascinated me. I started this journey 16 years
             ago but was given the surprise of my lifetime and found out I was having a daughter.
        She's old enough now that I can finally persue the goal that has eluded me for so long. A career
      in software development. ðŸ™Œ</p>
        <h3>And now for something else...</h3>
                <p>While software is my number one interest. I am not a one trick pony. My recipe following game
              is real strong. It all started after watching that damn <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>. ðŸ˜† I finally attempted
            a Paul Hollywood recipe. The following is a picture of the Paul Hollywood carrot cake I made recently.</p>
