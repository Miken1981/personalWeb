            <h2><strong>Hey Now</strong></h2>
              <p>My name is Michael Nancett. I am an aspiring
                web developer living in California's central valley. ðŸ˜Ž Modesto, Ca
                to be exact. It's the perfect middle ground to the big cities of the bay area
                 or the nature of the various beaches, and forests around me. I currently work in the healthcare
                 industry as a pharmacy tech. Web development has always interested me, honestly much of programming, does.
                 I started with swift and building an app, and wanted more.  So I started tinkering with html
                and css found I really enjoyed that. I decided I wanted to take that interest and
                make a career doing something I enjoy.</p>

            <h2>About Me:</h2>
              <p>The challenge in software design has become a new thrill for me.  I currently work in a very structured enviroment
              which leaves a lot to be desired.  I love the freedom with software development.  The main limitations are my imagination
            and my knowledge. Since my imagintation knows no bounds, and I will never stop learning, the skies the limit in coding. I am
            always looking for new projects I'm passionate in, or people I'm passionate to work with.</p>
      <!--  DO I WANT TO USE????
       Web development has been something that has been an interest for me for almost 2
       decades now.  I have been on the internet since dial up. I remember very early basic
      websites and their evolution has always fascinated me. I started this journey 16 years
      ago but was given the surprise of my lifetime and found out I was having a daughter.
      She's old enough now that I can finally persue the goal that has eluded me for so long. A career
      in software development. ðŸ™Œ -->
