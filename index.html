      <h2><strong>Hey Now</strong></h2>
      <p>My name is Michael Nancett. I am an aspiring
        web developer living in California's central valley. ðŸ˜Ž Modesto, Ca
        to be exact. It's the perfect middle ground to the big cities of the bay area
        or the nature of the various beaches, and forests around me. I currently work in the healthcare
        industry as a pharmacy tech. Web development has always interested me, honestly much of programming, does.
        I started with swift and building an app, and wanted more. So I started tinkering with html
        and css found I really enjoyed that. I decided I wanted to take that interest and
        make a career doing something I enjoy.</p>

      <h3>Bonus facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Live Music. I am a live music addict. I can not get enough of a
          good show</li>
        <li>Console Games. I'm dating myself here but first console I played on
          an Atari 2600. ðŸ˜¬</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My recipe following game is real strong. It all started after watching that damn <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>.
        ðŸ˜† I finally attempted a Paul Hollywood recipe. The following is a picture of the Paul Hollywood carrot cake I made recently.</p>

      <h2 id="about">About Me:</h2>
      <p>The challenge in software design has become a new thrill for me. I currently work in a very structured enviroment
        which leaves a lot to be desired. I love the freedom with software development. The main limitations are my imagination
        and my knowledge. Since my imagintation knows no bounds, and I will never stop learning, the skies the limit in coding. I am
        always looking for new projects I'm passionate in, or people I'm passionate to work with.</p>
      <!--  DO I WANT TO USE????
       Web development has been something that has been an interest for me for almost 2
       decades now.  I have been on the internet since dial up. I remember very early basic
      websites and their evolution has always fascinated me. I started this journey 16 years
      ago but was given the surprise of my lifetime and found out I was having a daughter.
      She's old enough now that I can finally persue the goal that has eluded me for so long. A career
      in software development. ðŸ™Œ -->

          up the messaging for a set of certitudes based on deductions founded on false
          premise. What about scaling components to a global audience? </p>
