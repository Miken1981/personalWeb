          <h2><strong>Hey Now</strong></h2>
          <p>My name is Michael Nancett. I am an aspiring web developer living in
            California's central valley. ðŸ˜Ž  It's the perfect middle ground to
            the big cities of the bay area or the nature of the various beaches,
            and forests around me. I currently work in the healthcare industry as
            a pharmacy tech. Web development has always interested me, honestly,
            much of programming does. I started with swift and building an app,
            and wanted more. So I started tinkering with HTML and CSS found I
             enjoyed that. I decided I wanted to take that interest and make a
             career doing something I enjoy.</p>

          <p>My recipe following game is real strong. It all started after watching <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>.
            ðŸ˜† I finally attempted a Paul Hollywood recipe. The following is a picture of the Paul Hollywood carrot cake I
            made recently.</p>

        <div class="item">
          <p>The challenge in software design has become a new thrill for me.
            I currently work in a very structured environment which leaves a lot
            to be desired. I love the freedom with software development. The main
            limitations are my imagination and my knowledge. Since my imagination
            knows no bounds, and I will never stop learning, the skies the limit
            in coding. I am always looking for new projects I'm passionate about
            or people I'm passionate to work with.</p>

        <!--  DO I WANT TO USE????
       Web development has been something that has been an interest for me for almost 2
       decades now.  I have been on the internet since dial up. I remember very early basic
      websites and their evolution has always fascinated me. I started this journey 16 years
      ago but was given the surprise of my lifetime and found out I was having a daughter.
      She's old enough now that I can finally persue the goal that has eluded me for so long. A career
      in software development. ðŸ™Œ -->
