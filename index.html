      <p>I currently work in the healthcare industry as a pharmacy tech.  I
        decided wanted to make the career change. Web development has always interested me, honestly much of programming,
        does. I started with swift and building an app, and wanted more.  So I started
        tinkering with html and css and decided I wanted to take that interest
        and make a career out of something I enjoy doing.</p>
